# StuDocu QA Engineer Assignment

This project is an automated test suite for user acceptance testing of the [Awesome QA Tool webpage web application](https://github.com/StuDocu/qa-engineer-assignment) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It includes tests for verifying UI elements and functionalities related to questions and answers. For details about the testing strategy consult [Test Plan]().

## Running the Tests

The test suite can be executed using any of the `npm` scripts listed below to run tests in your desired configuration. Simply run one of the following commands in your terminal follwing this standard.

```bash
npm run <command>
```
Example:
```bash
$ npm run BROWSER=chromium test:browser
```
> Note: A local web server on `http://localhost:8000` will automatically start on each test execution, even so a npm `start-server` script exists in case you want to manually explore the web page.

#### Running the tests without npm scripts

> To run the test suite with different settings or to specify tests without using npm scripts, please refer to the Playwright's [Running and debugging tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests) documentation.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project integrates [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as its CI/CD platform.

A workflow is already integrated into this repository, which automates a full test run in an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) virtual machine every time a pull request is created for the `main` branch.

The setup file can be found in the following path: [.github/workflows/ui-test-automation.yml](.github/workflows/ui-test-automation.yml)
